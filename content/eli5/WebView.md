## Why?
Embeddable browser for native apps to render visuals. Think of it like a browser, Chrome, Safari, but can be embedded into native UI apps. 

Also you get to interact with external apis through native bridge. Apps with webview are isolated for security purposes.

## UseCases

- Can be used to displaying content, instead of using default device browser, an in-app browser is used to render it. Example; Twitter, FB. If you click on any link, it opens the link in the in-app browser. Like almost all social media apps, use in-app webview to render content.
