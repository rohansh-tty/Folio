Hello, I am Rohan Shetty, few pointers about me
* 🌏 I'm from Udupi, KA. Currently working in Bangalore.
* 💼 I am a Software Developer @ Machani Robotics where I work on building HumanoidOS & adding AI capabilities to Sophia.
* 💙 I'm into Football, FIFA/PES, F1 & Human Behaviour. I spend time reading The Ken, Hackernews, Manas Saloi, Paul Graham Blogs, etc. My recent hobbies include building chrome extensions and binge-listening to Andrew Huberman's Podcast.
* 💃🏼 **Fun Fact**: If not Tech, I wanted to be a Football Manager. I still have this in mind, maybe in my 40-50s, I'll leave everything, and coach a 4th Division Italian team, following the footsteps of Maurizio Sarri.
