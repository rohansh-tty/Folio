## How I got started in AI?

My logic behind working on AI was simple, I love numbers and I would like crunching them for my whole life. Sounds creepy, but that's how I got started with Data Science, slowly moved up the ladder and started working on Computer Vision Projects

The next thing I know, I didn't like it. I didn't wanna train a model, collect data for it, do augmentations, etc. Yeah all this sounds fun, but it mostly gets monotonous. I didn't like where this was going. I had to do something about this. Also I just got graduated and was looking for a job. 

Now in terms on Jobs related to ML, Data Science, the entry barrier is a bit high for starters. Like you would need to collect data, do augmentations, train your model using TensorFlow/PyTorch, do inference using DeepStream etc. While in Software Development, if you could create a simple web app using React, and a server using Node.js with MongoDB, you have higher chance of getting. For the former one, that's the minimum you should know. Latter one has got diversity, if you know React well, you can work as Frontend Developer, or if you like working on Node.js and Databases, you can as well work as a Backend guy. The point is in Development, you have low entry barrier.
